  <h1>Rules of Poker: Texas Hold'em</h1>

  <h2>Objective of the Game</h2>
  <p>The objective of Texas Hold'em is to win chips by forming the best possible poker hand or by bluffing to make other
    players fold. The winner is the player with the most chips at the end of the game or the one who wins all the chips
    during play.</p>

  <h2>Basic Gameplay</h2>
  <p>Texas Hold'em uses a standard deck of 52 playing cards. Players are dealt two private cards ("hole cards"), and
    five community cards are placed face-up on the table. Players use a combination of their hole cards and the
    community cards to make the best possible five-card poker hand.</p>

  <h2>Betting Rounds</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Pre-Flop:</strong> Players receive their hole cards and place their initial bets. Betting continues
      until all players have called or folded.</li>
    <li><strong>The Flop:</strong> Three community cards are dealt face-up. Players bet again, starting with the player
      to the left of the dealer.</li>
    <li><strong>The Turn:</strong> A fourth community card is dealt face-up. Another round of betting follows.</li>
    <li><strong>The River:</strong> A fifth and final community card is dealt face-up. The final round of betting takes
      place.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Showdown</h2>
  <p>If more than one player remains after the final round of betting, a showdown occurs. Players reveal their hole
    cards, and the best hand wins. The ranking of poker hands from highest to lowest is as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Royal Flush:</strong> A, K, Q, J, 10, all of the same suit.</li>
    <li><strong>Straight Flush:</strong> Five consecutive cards of the same suit.</li>
    <li><strong>Four of a Kind:</strong> Four cards of the same rank.</li>
    <li><strong>Full House:</strong> Three of a kind and a pair.</li>
    <li><strong>Flush:</strong> Five cards of the same suit.</li>
    <li><strong>Straight:</strong> Five consecutive cards of any suit.</li>
    <li><strong>Three of a Kind:</strong> Three cards of the same rank.</li>
    <li><strong>Two Pair:</strong> Two pairs of cards of different ranks.</li>
    <li><strong>One Pair:</strong> Two cards of the same rank.</li>
    <li><strong>High Card:</strong> The highest card in a hand without a combination.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Winning and Losing</h2>
  <p>The winner is the player with the best hand during the showdown or the one who forces all other players to fold by
    bluffing. The game can end when one player has all the chips or when players decide to end the game.</p>

  <p>Now you're ready to play Texas Hold'em! Good luck!</p>
